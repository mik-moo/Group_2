# Presentation Plan

- Our topic is wine quality prediction.

- We selected this topic because it seemed interesting and provided a challenge.  It was also an emotionally lighter and happier topic than some others we considered.

- The datasets used are Red Wine Quality (winequality-red.csv) and White Wine Quality (winequality-white.csv) available from <https://www.kaggle.com/>

- We hope to be able to predict the quality score (0-10) of both red and white wines using the following features:
  
  - fixed acidity
  - volatile acidity
  - citric acid
  - residual sugar
  - chlorides
  - free sulfur dioxide
  - total sulfur dioxide
  - density
  - pH
  - sulphates
  - alcohol
