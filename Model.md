# Model Design

## What model and why?

* We will build an unsupervised learning model with a clustering algorithm.  We chose this model because it is the best option for grouping the red and white wine data to predict the quality score of the next wine.

* We will split, train and test the model by fitting the model with the trained wine data.

* We will then add new wine data and see if the model can predict the quality of the new wine data set.
