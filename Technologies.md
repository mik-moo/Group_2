## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
 For the database section, we will utilize an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) in addition to pgAdmin 4 within Postgres SQL for data storage.

## Machine Learning
In the machine learning portion, our training a unsupervised learning model with a K-means clustering algorithm.
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Extra ML verbiage here.


## Dashboard
We will use Tableau to display the data and presentation.
