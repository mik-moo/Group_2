# Read Between the Wines

## Overview

Red and White Wine datasets were combined and machine learning was used to predict a quality score of 0-10.

## Results

## Summary

### Resources

Datasets used were Red Wine Quality (winequality-red.csv) and White Wine Quality (winequality-white.csv) available from <https://www.kaggle.com/>

## Presentation Plan

- Our topic is wine quality prediction.

- We selected this topic because it seemed interesting and provided a challenge.  It was also an emotionally lighter and happier topic than some others we considered.

- The datasets used are Red Wine Quality (winequality-red.csv) and White Wine Quality (winequality-white.csv) available from <https://www.kaggle.com/>

- We hope to be able to predict the quality score (0-10) of both red and white wines using the following features:
  
  - fixed acidity
  - volatile acidity
  - citric acid
  - residual sugar
  - chlorides
  - free sulfur dioxide
  - total sulfur dioxide
  - density
  - pH
  - sulphates
  - alcohol

## Communication Protocol

- Our team will meet during class time and Sundays.
  - Evening meetings as needed and available.

- We will openly communicate in our Slack channel.

- Contact by phone for anything that is pressing or time sensitive.

- Partial team may meet for trouble-shooting or assistance based on availability, but will update the resolution or continuing issue in the Slack channel to keep everyone on the same page.

- Slack channel will be used for sharing ideas, issues, successes and other information related to the project's progress and deliverables timeline.
