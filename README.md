## Read Between the Wines

## Project Overview
The project is on Wine Quality Prediction. We are using different types of white and red wines to predict the quality. The red wine and the white wine dataset were combined, and a machine was used to predict quality score of one to ten.

The datasets, Red Wine Quality (winequality-red.csv) and White Wine Quality (winequality-white.csv) are from https://www.kaggle.com/
The features used for the prediction are listed below in order of importance

•	Total sulfur dioxide

•	Chlorides

•	Volatile acidity

•	density

•	Sulphates

•	Residual Sugar

•	Fixed Acidity

•	Free Sulphur dioxide

•	PH

• Citric Acid

•	Alcohol

•	Quality

### Alcohol Rating
In this rating, Good Red Wine is 1.11 variance of alcohol, Good Red Wine 1.51 variance of alcohol, Bad White Wine is 1.43 variance of alcohol and Bad Red Wine is 1.13 variance of alcohol.

### Wine Types & Features
From the diagram, there is a difference between the white and Red wines in Average Fixed Density and Average Residual Sugar but there is not a significant difference for white and red wines in Average Alcohol, Average Density, Average Quality, Average Sulphate, and Average Density.
